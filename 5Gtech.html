<h1>5G technology and Networks</h1></center>
<p>Do you want to know more about 5G technology? Then you're in the right place.<br><br>
Let's see how 5G technology is about to change the world.<br><br><center>

<h2 id="1">What is 5G?</h2>
<p>5G technology is a breakthrough.</p><p>The next generation of telecom networks (fifth generation or 5G) has started hitting the market end of 2018 and will continue to expand worldwide.</p>
<p>Beyond speed improvement, the technology is expected to unleash a massive 5G IoT (Internet of Things) ecosystem where networks can serve communication needs for billions of connected devices, with the right trade-offs between speed, latency, and cost.</p>
<p>This makes sense if you think about what 5G has to offer.</p>
<h3>5G technology is driven by 8 specification requirements:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Up to 10Gbps data rate > 10 to 100x speed improvement over 4G and 4.5G networks </li>
<li>1-millisecond latency </li>
<li>1000x bandwidth per unit are </li>
<li> 
Up to 100x number of connected devices per unit area (compared with 4G LTE)</li>
<li>99.999% availability </li>
<li> 100% coverage,90% reduction in network energy usage</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2">How Fast is 5G?</h2>
<p>5G speed tops out at 10 gigabits per second (Gbps).

5G is 10 to x100 faster than what you can get with 4G.

 </p>
<p>What makes 5G faster? Good question!</p>
<p> According to communication principles, the shorter the frequency, the larger the bandwidth.</p>
<p>The use of <b>shorter frequencies</b> (millimeter waves between 30GHz and 300GHz) for 5G networks is why 5G can be faster. This high-band 5G spectrum provides the expected boost not only in speed but also in capacity, low latency, and quality.</p>

<p>However,<b>5G download speed </b>may differ widely by area.
According to the February 2020 issue of Fortune Magazine, average 5G speed measures done in Q3/Q4 2019 </p>
<ul>
<li>220 megabytes per second (Mbps) in Las Vegas</li>
<li>350 in New York,</li> 
<li>380 in Los Angeles,</li>
<li>450 in Dallas,</li>
<li>to 550 Chicago,
</li>
<li>and over 950 in Minneapolis and Providence approximatively.</li></ul>

<p>That's 10 to 50 times more than<span/> 4G LTE. </span></p>

<h2 id="3">What is 5g low latency/</h2>
<p> 5G technology offers an extremely low latency rate, the delay between the sending and receiving information. From 200 milliseconds for 4G, we go down to 1 millisecond(1ms) with 5G.</p>
<p>A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second.  </p>
<p>
The average reaction time for humans to a visual stimulus is 250 ms or 1/4 of a second. People are capped at around 190-200 ms with proper training. </p>
<p> Imagine now that your car could react 250 times faster than you.</p>
<p>Imagine it could also respond to hundreds of incoming information and can also communicate its reactions back to other vehicles and road signals all within milliseconds. </p>
<p>
At 60 mph (100km/h), the reaction distance is about 33 yards (30 meters) before you pull on the brakes. With a 1ms reaction time, the car would only have rolled a bit more than one inch (less than 3 centimeters). </p>

<b> LETS SEE WHAT MAKES 5G SO DIFFERENT FROM 4G</b>
<h2 id="4">5G vs 4G - What is the difference?</h2>
<p>The main evolution compared with todayâ€™s 4G and 4.5G (aka LTE advanced, LTE-A, LTE+ or 4G+) is that, beyond data speed improvements, new IoT and critical communication use cases will require a new level of improved performance.</p>
<ul>
<li> For example,<b> low latency </b>provides real-time interactivity for services using the cloud: this is key to the success of self-driving cars, for example.</li>
<li>5G vs 4G also means at least x100 devices connected. 5G must be able to support 1 million devices for 0.386 square miles or 1 km2. </li>

<li> Also, low power consumption is what will allow connected objects to operate for months or years without the need for human assistance</li></ul>
